# VeriHub — LLM Audit & Drift Dashboard

VeriHub helps organisations monitor what public LLMs say about them (FR/NL/EN) so customers don’t get misled by wrong or outdated “first answers”.
We run recurring Q&A audits, flag high-risk issues (wrong/outdated answers, missing sources, FR/NL drift), guide fast fixes on official pages/FAQs, and recheck the before/after delta.

**Status:** pilot-ready prototype. **Public MVP launch:** March 2026.  
**Looking for:** 1–2 pilot partners in Belgium (FR/NL).

## Why this matters

LLM answers scale. A single outdated link, wrong phone number, missing deadline, or inconsistent FR/NL instruction can propagate across thousands of interactions and cause real-world harm: missed deadlines, incorrect submissions, extra helpdesk load, and loss of trust.

## 🚀 Why VeriHub?
In the AI-first world, your reputation isn't in search results; it's in LLM responses. 
- **EU AI Act Ready**: Helping regulated sectors (Finance, Insurance, Utilities) comply with accuracy requirements.
- **Multilingual Native**: Automated detection of FR/NL drift—the #1 pain point for Belgian enterprises.
- **Measurable ROI**: Move from "AI says wrong things" to a structured "Operating Loop" with measurable improvements.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Overview with metrics, finding counts by type/severity/language
- **Facts Hub**: CRUD operations for verified facts with FR/NL pairs
- **Question Sets**: Pre-defined question sets for auditing LLM responses
- **Audit Runs**: Execute audits with different LLM providers (mock-baseline, mock-after, openai)
- **Findings Detection**: Automatic detection of incorrect, outdated, ungrounded, and drift issues
- **Before/After Comparison**: Compare two audit runs to see improvements

## 🛠 Tech & Trust
Built with a production-grade stack (React, Express, PostgreSQL, MCP) and ready for enterprise pilots.

### Dashboard — key metrics and severity overview
![Dashboard view showing total findings, critical issues, FR/NL drift, and severity distribution](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)

The dashboard summarizes the most recent audit results: total findings across runs, critical issues (severity 8–10), FR/NL drift count, and a severity distribution breakdown.

### Findings — actionable issue list with suggested fixes
![Findings view showing filters, issue cards, and suggested fixes for incorrect answers and FR/NL drift](docs/screenshots/findings.png)

The findings page provides a filterable list of detected issues (incorrect, outdated, ungrounded, FR/NL drift). Each item includes evidence (expected vs actual) and a suggested fix to reduce real-world harm (wrong fees, outdated links, inconsistent procedures across languages).

## API Documentation

OpenAPI specification is available at `openapi.yaml`.

### Key Endpoints

- `GET /api/dashboard/metrics` - Dashboard metrics
- `GET /api/facts` - List all facts
- `POST /api/facts` - Create a fact
- `GET /api/question-sets` - List question sets
- `GET /api/audit-runs` - List audit runs
- `POST /api/audit-runs` - Create audit run
- `GET /api/audit-runs/:id/findings` - Get findings for run
- `GET /api/comparison/:baselineId/:currentId` - Compare two runs

## Data Artifacts

### Facts Seed (`data/facts/facts_seed_v2.json`)
28 facts with FR/NL pairs covering:
- Appointment links
- Contact information (phone, email, address)
- Opening hours
- Deadline days
- Fees and payment methods
- Required documents

### Question Set (`data/question_sets/question_set_demoville_fr_nl_v2.json`)

### openai (not implemented)
Placeholder for real OpenAI integration.

## Deployment

### Render/Fly.io/Railway

1. Set environment variables:
   - `DB_MODE=postgres`
   - `DATABASE_URL=<your-postgres-url>`

2. Build command: `npm run build`

3. Start command: `npm run start`

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `PORT` | Server port | `5000` | No |

## MCP Tool Server

VeriHub Civic includes a minimal MCP-style tool server that exposes two tools for programmatic access:

### Available Tools

1. **search_facts** - Search verified facts in the database
   - `query` (required): Search query string
   - `lang` (optional): Filter by language (`fr` or `nl`)

2. **list_findings** - List findings from an audit run
   - `run_id` (required): Audit run ID
   - `type` (optional): Filter by finding type (`incorrect`, `outdated`, `ungrounded`, `drift`)
   - `min_severity` (optional): Minimum severity threshold (0-1)

### Starting the MCP Server

```bash
# Start MCP server (default port 3001)
npx tsx server/mcp/index.ts

# Or with custom port
MCP_PORT=3002 npx tsx server/mcp/index.ts
```

### Example Requests

```bash
# List available tools
curl http://localhost:3001/tools

# Search facts
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/tools/search_facts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "phone", "lang": "fr"}'

# List findings for a run
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/tools/list_findings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"run_id": "run-123", "type": "incorrect", "min_severity": 0.5}'

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### MCP Integration Potential

The tool server enables:
- Real-time fact verification from external sources
- Multi-model LLM comparison
- Integration with document management systems
- Automated fact updates from trusted sources

## Security & privacy notes (prototype)

- The demo runs on local data and does not require customer data.
- When used in pilots, we aim to minimise stored content and keep a clear audit trail of sources and changes.
- MVP roadmap includes roles/access control, audit logs, retention controls, and deployment options suitable for regulated environments.
