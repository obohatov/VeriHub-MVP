You are Replit AI Agent. Please make a practical, minimal set of improvements to the existing project “VeriHub Civic — LLM Audit & Drift Dashboard” to strengthen compliance with the Zoomcamp project requirements, without overengineering or rewriting the stack.

Current state:
- Full-stack already works: React + Vite + TypeScript (client), Express + TypeScript (server).
- DB layer exists (SQLite for dev + Postgres via docker-compose), migrations exist, CI checks pass.
- OpenAPI exists as a committed openapi.yaml, and there is an export script (server/scripts/export_openapi.ts).
- Artifacts are already in the repo and must remain the source of truth:
  - data/question_sets/question_set_demoville_fr_nl_v2.json
  - data/facts/facts_seed_v2.json
  - data/mock/mock_llm_answers_baseline.json
  - data/mock/mock_llm_answers_after.json
  - data/scoring_rules.yaml
  - Verified sources markdown are served from client/public/data/sources/*.md and must remain accessible via /data/sources/...

Goals (do these, keep it minimal):
1) Minimal real MCP implementation (not just documentation)
   - Add a tiny MCP server (or MCP-like tool server) under server/mcp/ with 2 tools:
     a) search_facts(query, lang?) -> returns matching facts from DB
     b) list_findings(run_id, type?, min_severity?) -> returns findings from DB
   - Provide a simple local run command and short README section:
     - how to start MCP server
     - example request payloads
   - Keep it lightweight: no auth, no external deps beyond what’s necessary.

2) Add OpenAPI validation into CI
   - Add a CI step that validates openapi.yaml (e.g., swagger-cli validate or redocly lint).
   - Ensure CI fails if OpenAPI is invalid.
   - Do not regenerate openapi.yaml automatically in CI; just validate it.

3) Add minimal frontend tests (1–2 tests only)
   - Use React Testing Library (or Vitest + RTL).
   - One test for Dashboard rendering key metrics (smoke test).
   - One test for Findings filters affecting the list (basic behavior).
   - Keep tests stable and fast. Add them to CI.

4) Add .env.example and tighten configuration docs
   - Create .env.example with PORT, DB_MODE, DATABASE_URL, and optional OPENAI_API_KEY.
   - Add a short “Configuration” section to README explaining defaults.
   - Add small runtime checks so missing required env vars produce a clear error message.

Constraints:
- Do not change the UI look-and-feel significantly.
- Do not rename endpoints unless truly necessary. If you change anything, update both frontend client and openapi.yaml.
- Do not remove existing unit/integration tests. Add only what is needed.
- Keep changes reviewable: prefer small commits and minimal files.

Deliverables:
- New MCP server code + README section + run command
- CI validates openapi.yaml
- 1–2 frontend tests running in CI
- .env.example and README config section

After implementation, print a brief checklist:
- MCP: entrypoint + run command + tools list
- OpenAPI validation: CI step name and command
- Frontend tests: how to run locally and in CI
- .env.example: variables included
